Dos:
- record gameplay
- record mic

Don'ts:
- enforce a play time
- give ideas or hints to what the game is before hand
- step in and give info, unless it is REALLY REALLY needed
- get information back with leading questions
	- ask things like what did you think about the game
	- not, what did you think about this mechanic
	- if they don't talk about it, it wasn't good/bad enough to care

game4:
- second last level was hard because pushing a rock with nother one wasnt introduced yet
